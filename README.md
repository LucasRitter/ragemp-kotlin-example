# RageMP + Kotlin = ❤

This is an example project that can also be used as
a boilerplate for RageMP + Kotlin development.

### Getting Started  🔰
Just clone the project and open it up in IntelliJ 😊.

You also need to download the latest build of the 
[RageMP + Kotlin library](https://github.com/LucasRitter/ragemp-kotlin-client/releases).
Just take the .jar file from there and put it in the `lib` folder.

If you want to build it and prepare it for RageMP,
select the `Package` run configuration at the top of your IDE.
Ignore any of the errors that might appear, I haven't figured out
how to suppress those yet 😞.
